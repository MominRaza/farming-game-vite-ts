This document outlines the step-by-step plan to build the farming game, ensuring that each stage ends with a working version.

## Milestone 1: Basic Game Layout
- Set up the main HTML structure: house, grass field, and initial plots grid.
- Add basic CSS for layout and responsiveness.
- Display a static grid of plots (no interactivity yet).
- **Goal:** Game screen looks like a farm, but no actions possible yet.

## Milestone 2: Plot Interactivity
- Make plots clickable.
- Allow player to create new plots (if not already present).
- **Goal:** Player can add plots to the field.

## Milestone 3: Planting Seeds
- Add a simple UI to select and plant seeds in empty plots.
- Show a visual change when a seed is planted.
- **Goal:** Player can plant seeds in plots.

## Milestone 4: Crop Growth
- Implement crop growth over time (with simple stages: seed → sprout → mature).
- Show different visuals for each stage.
- **Goal:** Planted seeds grow into crops automatically.

## Milestone 5: Watering & Compost
- Add buttons to water or add compost to planted plots.
- Watering/composting speeds up growth.
- Show visual feedback for watering/composting.
- **Goal:** Player can interact with crops to help them grow.

## Milestone 6: Harvesting
- Allow player to harvest mature crops.
- Remove harvested crop from plot and add to inventory.
- **Goal:** Player can harvest crops and see them in inventory.

## Milestone 7: Selling Crops & Earning Coins
- Add a UI to sell harvested crops for coins.
- Display coin balance.
- **Goal:** Player can sell crops and earn coins.

## Milestone 8: Shop & Buying Seeds
- Implement a shop to buy different types of seeds using coins.
- Add new seed types to inventory.
- **Goal:** Player can buy and plant new seeds.

## Milestone 9: Expanding the Farm
- Allow player to use coins to create more plots.
- **Goal:** Player can expand the farm as they earn more coins.

## Milestone 10: Polish & Optional Features
- Add animations, sound, and polish UI.
- Consider optional features (crop withering, weather, decorations, achievements).
- **Goal:** Game feels complete and fun to play.
