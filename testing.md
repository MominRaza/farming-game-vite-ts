# Testing & QA Plan

This document outlines how features will be tested in the farming game.

## Manual Testing
- Test each milestone after implementation (see planning.md).
- Check all actions: planting, watering, composting, harvesting, selling, buying, expanding.
- Test on both desktop and mobile browsers.
- Verify UI updates and error handling.

## Automated Testing (Future)
- Add unit tests for core logic (TypeScript functions).
- Use a test framework (e.g., Jest) for logic tests.

## Bug Tracking
- Keep a list of known issues and bugs in a separate file or project board.
